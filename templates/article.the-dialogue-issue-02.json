It involves some form of daily mindfulness to fill the space in between work and the social things, like journaling, meditating, reading books on life, listening to Dharma talks, and practicing yoga 2x a week plus homework as part of Triyoga TT.<\/p><p>Sounds trite, but the contentment has settled in. I mean true contentment, not the fleeting, illusory kind that you struggle to hold onto. At least I think it has. It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, right?<\/p><p>So this <em>Santosha,<\/em> or feeling at peace with myself, has been here for a few weeks, unwaveringly, and I’m going to take it. It feels like I’m metaphorically deeply rooted into the earth, like no gust of wind or hurricane can move me now.<\/p><p>It’s that time of year where another trip around the sun is almost over. Bye 2021, together with its stray sibling, 2020. Maybe we are supposed to feel a pinch of sadness for lost time or lost youth every year. But maybe this year, more than any other in recent memory, the saying “it can only go up from here” applies. Literally.<\/p><p>So let’s embrace it. Let’s look back on the Great Pandemic years and think of exponential, not linear, personal growth. What are yours? For me: I am more self-aware. I am kinder and more compassionate. I am less driven by tangible, materialistic things. I found a deeper meaning through work. I found more intention through design and community. I strengthened my commitment to our planet (note to self: make time for Green Office Hours in 2022). I’m finding my voice, and I’m using it. <\/p><p>And yes, I might be one big fat cliché – but I’m here for it. So, 2022, let’s go.<\/p>"
